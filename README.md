# Matrix .NET SDK [![#dotnet:half-shot.uk](https://img.shields.io/matrix/dotnet:half-shot.uk.svg?server_fqdn=matrix.half-shot.uk&label=%23dotnet:half-shot.uk&logo=matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/#dotnet:half-shot.uk)

This project provides a SDK for interfacing with the Matrix Protocol.

It has support for a limited subset of the C2S and AS APIs presently. Support for new endpoints is easy to add,
so please ask if you want a endpoint to be added.

The SDK is built against `netstandard2.0`, and will work with .NET core projects.
